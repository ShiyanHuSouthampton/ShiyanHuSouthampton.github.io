<p>The provision of energy is a key issue at the heart of modern society: where do we get it from, how do we use it, and is there enough of it for what we want? Our growing thirst for energy must either be matched by supply or else adapted to meet it. Tackling these challenges is an essential part of many fields of research &ndash; both in the natural and social and behavioural sciences and economics &ndash; and is the focus of multi-billion-dollar global industries.</p>

<p>Solar Energy, the official journal of the International Solar Energy Society, is devoted exclusively to the science and technology of solar energy applications. Solar Energy welcomes manuscripts presenting information not previously published in journals on any aspect of solar energy research, development, application, measurement or policy. The term &ldquo;solar energy&rdquo; in this context includes the indirect uses such as wind energy and biomass. Because of the international character of Solar Energy, articles that deal solely with the solar radiation or wind data base of a specific country are not normally considered suitable for Solar Energy. Submitted manuscripts may take the form of reports of original studies or reviews of significant prior work in a given area. All manuscripts are subject to reviews to assure accuracy, clarity, and long-term value.</p>
